Affiliated with 7 Nobel laureates, it has produced 5 NASA astronauts, 7 Marshall scholars, 4 Churchill scholars, 29 Truman scholars, and 50 Rhodes scholars. Thomas Jefferson founded the University of Virginia in 1819. He wished the publicly-supported school to have a national character and stature. It is the first non-sectarian university in the United States and the first to use the elective course system. Jefferson considered the founding of the university to be one of his greatest achievements. Undertaking the project toward the end of his life after a long and illustrious career that included serving as a colonial revolutionary, political leader, writer, architect, inventor, and horticulturalist, he was closely involved in the university's design. He planned the curriculum, recruited the first faculty, and designed the Academical Village, a terraced green space surrounded by residential and academic buildings, gardens, and the majestic center-point, the Rotunda. The most recognizable symbol of the university, the Rotunda stands at the north end of the Lawn and is half the height and width of the Pantheon in Rome which was the primary inspiration for the building. The Lawn and the Rotunda have served as models for similar designs of centralized green areas at universities across the United States. The university was opened for classes in 1825 with a faculty of eight and a student body numbering sixty-eight. Jefferson took great pains to recruit the most highly qualified faculty, five of whom were found in England and three in the United States. Instructions were offered in ancient languages, modern languages, mathematics, moral philosophy, natural philosophy, chemistry, law, and medicine. Jefferson opposed the granting of degrees on the grounds that they were ‘artificial embellishments’. In 1824, however, the Board of Visitors authorized granting the Master of Arts degree. The Doctor of Medicine or M.D. was awarded to the first graduates of the School of Medicine in 1828 and the Bachelor of Law degree or LL.B. was first awarded for law school graduates in 1842. The bachelor's degree was awarded beginning in 1849, but became the standard undergraduate degree and a prerequisite for the master's degree in 1899 bringing the university into conformity with other institutions of higher learning. The PhD has been awarded since 1883."

University of Phoenix is designed specifically for adult learners. Unlike typical college students aged 18 - 22, adult learners often have to balance family life and careers alongside their education. The rigid schedules and in-person requirements of traditional universities mean many adult learners spend up to 10 years pursuing their degree.    That’s why Dr. John Sperling founded University of Phoenix in 1976. Dr. Sperling grew up poor and struggled with a learning disability, seeing firsthand what it was like to struggle in an educational system that did not meet his needs. In response, he established the University to make higher education available to adults who wanted to learn real-world knowledge on their chosen terms.    Since our founding, we have done just that. University of Phoenix gives students access to quality education paired with support and resources well after graduation.    With dedication to innovation, University of Phoenix has transformed the higher education experience with virtual learning programs. We have offered online degrees since 1989, scheduling classes on a 24/7 basis so students can learn at any time and from any place.   University of Phoenix is accredited by the [Higher Learning Commission] (http://hlcommission.org). We offer certificates as well as associate, bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees programs with over 100 options mapped to over 300 potential career paths. As of 2020, University of Phoenix has celebrated 1,052,599 student alumni from over 80 countries.    The benefits of the University extend far beyond our flexible coursework. We are here to give our graduates the ongoing support they need to pursue opportunities in their chosen careers:  - Career Services for Life® commitment provides one-on-one career coaching and workshops to all University of Phoenix students and graduates.  - Over 50 alumni chapters and the PhoenixLink Network connect graduates with potential job opportunities.  - Students have 24/7 remote access to our digital library, which has thousands of eBooks and journals available on demand.  - Students can also access self-guided or vendor-provided tutoring for math or writing through a dedicated tutoring portal.  - University of Phoenix offers partial tuition scholarships to eligible students. The complimentary iGrad® service helps teach students how to budget, save and borrow money responsibly. We also offer the iLife Resource Center to connect students with counseling and life coaching options for housing, time management, and more.   Since 1976, University of Phoenix has granted over 1.2 million degrees and certificates. Learning is far from easy, but the University aims to make learning more practical for working adults. Many of our students are nontraditional who are driven to meet their academic and professional goals. University of Phoenix has supported students for decades, striving to make it as accessible as possible for working adults to unlock their future with flexible degree paths."

Openhouse,"EdTech, Education","16,266","About Us  If you think back to your school or college days, the best memories you have are those with your friends! Your first day in college, your best friend, your dorms, hanging in the corridors, your school canteen, all nighters before exams & chilling for weeks after exams - our school lives are filled with so many awesome interactions, experiences & memories. In each of them you’re with a friend, never alone! Humans always have, and will always continue to learn from one another. We are a social learning platform that allows us to learn the way we learn best - socially Founded by Stanford grads, Openhouse is backed by Accel and Matrix Partners. We have started building a stellar team from companies like Microsoft, Uber, etc.,  We are headquartered in Bangalore.  Our Approach Covid-19 has reshaped every aspect of our lives and education is no exception. The world is learning to learn online but the main reason why online education hasn’t skyrocketed is because all platforms are designed to simply deliver content (whether pre-recorded or live). Online learning doesn’t feel natural, warm or relatable. Taking an analogy from the gaming world, edtech so far consists of single player games designed only for access but not engagement & retention. The only actions one can take is content consumption and practice via multiple choice questions. We, on the contrary, think education is an immersive multiplayer experience! If our children are going to learn online we will have to make it social. That’s how learning happens best. We believe we’re amongst the first few companies in the world trying to push the boundaries of edtech to a new era of highly social & community driven learning. PS: We believe that we need to hire people who are toughened by failure, not those coddled by success. Our Culture The best classrooms have an awesome learning culture. We think of our organisation as one large classroom, where each of us is a student trying to learn from & teach one another.  We have all sorts of people here: humanists, tech junkies, educationists, designers & wanna be designers! Since we are a small organisation, we function like a tight-knit family where we care for each other’s work but also for each other’s lives. We’ve often heard that the first 50 team members set the culture & pace of an organisation, which is why we take time and carefully pick our team. If you grab a sneak peek into our tribe, you’d find us to be super real. We are all encouraged to call a spade a spade, even if this means disappointing a peer. Coming up with prospective solutions is good, but we care about how well the experience is crafted - aesthetics do matter. Think of Disneyland, Nike, Airbnb, WeWork, Apple: the best folks know not only how to deliver a product/service, but also make it beautiful. Most importantly, we are all students! Right across the team. from engineering to product, community to classroom, we think of how we’d feel if we were students – and this reminds us to keep learning and growing!"
